####Assignment for 2/4/2015

For this assignment you will add a gruntfile and a package.json file to your previous assignment.

The package.json file should include all the dependencies and dev devpendencies for the project.

The Gruntfile should contain a task to run the mocha/chai test as well as run jshint on all of your code. This should include your tests and your Gruntfile.

Submit as a pull request to your own repo that contains just the code for this assingment(Gruntfile, package.json and jshint config file if applicable).

####Bonus:
For an extra point, set up a watch task that reruns your tests/jshint/jscs on changes to any of your files (minus package.json)

For another bonus point move the jshint options (node and globals) into a jshintrc file that you can transfer between projects.
